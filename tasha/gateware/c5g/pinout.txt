Identify the pins of interest on the 40 pin GPIO connector (on the left side of
the board). Mind the key: the picture below is correct only if you are looking
at the board upside down. The 5v and 3.3v pins aren't used, but are marked
because connecting to them by accident could concievably cause damage.

key:
    G: ground
    5: 5v out. don't connect by accident!!
    3: 3.3v out. don't connect by accident!!
    C: generated clock out

    a: p1d0 data output
    b: latch input
    c: p1d1 data output
    d: p1 clock input
    e: p2d0 data output
    f: p2 clock input
    g: p2d1 data output
