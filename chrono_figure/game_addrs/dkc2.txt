# this file (and others like it) list the addresses relevant to Chrono Figure.
# this one is for DKC2 US v1.1.
# the format is <24 bit address in hex> = <kind>
# kind can be:
#   nmi: first instruction in the NMI handler. there can only be one.
#   reset: first instruction in the reset handler. there can only be one.
#   wait_start: first instruction of a wait for NMI loop. there can be many.
#   wait_end: first instruction after a wait for NMI loop. there can be many.

# all of these are WAI instructions so the fact that they're not executing
# guarantees the loop is over
